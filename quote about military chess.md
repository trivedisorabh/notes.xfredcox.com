- **Mar 12** - This [quote about military chess] reminds me a lot of the lean startup movement and the strategy of "probing and testing" to deduce a viable business model.

> "I once read a description of a variant on the game of chess, played at military academies. Two players sit at separate boards set up with only their own pieces, out of sight of each other, and a referee supervises the game. Each player makes their move in turn and the referee is responsible for informing them how the other's move impacts on their own pieces and how the other's disposition of pieces impact on their intended move. The player is informed only when one of their own pieces is taken, when one of their moves is affected by interacting with one of their opponents pieces (i.e. a player may want to move a bishop across the board but the referee may inform them that their move was stopped four squares early when the bishop took a pawn from the other side) and when one of their opponents pieces is sitting on a square adjacent to one of their own. The game is used to teach battlefield strategy. To win a player must probe and test to deduce his opponent's disposition, while planing and executing a response that will achieve the desired checkmate."
