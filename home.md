**May 4th - May 10th**

- [Google Analytics Primer]

**Apr 27th - May 3rd**

- [Java Primer] - Study notes for the Oracle SE7 Certified Associate exam.

**Apr 20th - Apr 26th**

- I've been using Firebase for a few different things. Their web interface is really handy at first, but as soon as you go into production and entries start growing, it becomes prohibitively slow. I'm considering building a small admin shell but haven't decided on the style - OO or similar to s3cmd...? [fb\_node\_admin on Github](https://github.com/xfredcox/fb_node_admin)
- [Common Crawl] is blowing my mind. There are dozens and dozens of papers published from the corpus but it feels like there should be thousands. I'll try to post some highlight over this week.

**Apr 13th - Apr 19th**

- A little checklist on how to do a [IPython Server Setup in 5min]. The reverse proxy with web sockets enabled is particularly worth saving for future reference.
- I open sourced *flash-card*, a polymer element that creates ANKI-like flash cards from google spreadsheets. You can find it over at [xfredcox/flash-cards](https://github.com/xfredcox/flash-cards). Pretty soon I'll integrate it into Atom Paper so you can seamlessly call the flashcard decks inside your content. 

**Mar 23rd - Mar 29th**

- Very good notes on [implementing SSL certification](https://bryce.fisher-fleig.org/blog/setting-up-ssl-on-aws-cloudfront-and-s3/).
- I want to try and have a look at the [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore) and [Github](https://developer.github.com/v3/) APIs to augment storage features on AP.

**Mar 16th - Mar 22nd**

- Started reading the [Berkshire Hathaway 2015 Annual Letter](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2014ltr.pdf) today.
- A high-level view of the algorithm for [NGINX Routing].
- A little revision of the [Python unittest Library].

**Mar 9th - Mar 15th**

- Back to basics Friday: [D3.js Primer]
- This [quote about military chess] reminds me a lot of the lean startup movement and the strategy of "probing and testing" to deduce a viable business model.
- AWS Whitepaper Notes: [Web Application Hosting in the AWS Cloud - Sep 2012]
- A few users raised issues about rendering on Internet Explorer so I had a little digression into the art of [Detecting Browsers]. Curiously, the best practice is "feature-" not "browser-detection" - despite the fact that major libraries are built on the later.
- I've been flirting with data visualisation for a while now and want to start saving my prototypes as reusable components. So I came across a great essay by Mike Bostock - here are some notes on [Reusable architecture in D3.js Charts].

**Mar 2nd - Mar 8th**

- AWS Whitepaper Notes: [Introduction to DevOps on AWS - Dec 2014]
- A bit of a change today. Here are some notes on the [Etsy - Form S-1]. The online retailer founded in 2005 is raising up to $100m, adding to the almost $100m already raised. I like the macro trends this business is exposed to - online/mobile retail, "small is beautiful", etc - so this is a company I want to keep track of.
- [Live Data - JSON Hosting](http://json.xfredcox.com/) - I built this cloud-based JSON data-store for myself and today I'm making it publicly available. It's really convenient for remotely storing JSON data that feeds into server-less applications. 
- [core-collapse] - The first of a series of studies in web components. This is a peak inside this Polymer core element.
- [AWS Certified Developer] - I'm considering taking the exam. Seems like they run a couple of examination sessions a month in central London.

**Feb 23rd - Mar 1st**

- [Static Hosting on S3] - The simplest, most economic, lightning fast way of hosting SPAs. A few notes on setup, advanced features and limitations.
- [CSS Positioning - Pure CSS] - Raw CSS position methods, floats and alignment.
- [Unittest Example: Random Account Naming in JS] - Following yesterday's entry, I wanted to implement a small unittest for the random name generator.
- [Random Account Naming in Javascript] - Similar to Heroku, this is a simple implementation of a random name generator.
